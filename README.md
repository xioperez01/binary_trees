Binary trees are data structures very similar to doubly linked lists, in the sense that they have two pointers that point to other elements, but they do not have a logical linear or sequential structure like those, but rather branched. They look like a tree, hence their name. **A binary tree is a non-linear data structure** in which each node can point to one or a maximum of two nodes. A recursive definition is also usually given that indicates that it is a structure composed of one data and two trees. These are simple definitions. This type of tree is characterized by having a main vertex and two branches emerge from it. The left branch and the right branch are also known as subtrees.
